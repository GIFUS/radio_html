Custom audio player for icecast2 and the like.

## About this
**To connect your icecast2, enter the desired link to the web player on line 15.** You can change everything for yourself, logo, links, etc. This is one of my first jobs using JS and html. The code may not be perfect, I will be happy to receive any criticism from you.
